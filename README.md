# pands-problem-sheet
Problem sheet for Programming and Scripting

WEEK 1 TASK: helloworld.py

Task 1 Description:
To create a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run then add, commit and push it into the pands-problem-sheet repository.

What it also entails: 
a. Creating a Github account containing two repositories: mywork (personal use) and pands-problem-sheet (for assessment) 
b. Making entries in README using markdown. 

Method:
1. Using VS Code, pands folder was created under the ATU HDip Computing in Data Analytics/Programming and Scripting WEDNESDAY 250123 directory.
2. 3 subfolders were created under pands: a. mywork  b. pands-course-material  c. pands-problem-sheet
3. helloworld.py file was created under pands-problem-sheet. Comments were added to describe the code.
4. Code format followed that of https://www.w3schools.com/python/.
5. Python print () function was used to create a string output onto the screen (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp).
6. Python quote function was used for string representation (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/single-and-double-quotes-python/#:~:text=Generally%2C%20double%20quotes%20are%20used,one%20type%20over%20the%20other).
7. Python bracket function indicates that round brackets are generally used in function (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30700603/different-meanings-of-brackets-in-python).

Conclusion:
Python program that displays Hello World! in the terminal was created, added, committed and pushed into https://github.com/nurbujang/pands-problem-sheet.git and submitted.

WEEK 2 TASK: bank.py

Task 2 Description:
Banks store currency figures as integers (usually in cent) to avoid rounding errors. This task is to create a program that should prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent), then add the two amounts and finally print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

Enter amount1(in cent): 65
Enter amount2(in cent): 180

The sum of these is €2.45

Method:
1. Define and prompt amount1. Input is a string or text, so it had to be converted into numbers (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-convert-string-to-int-how-to-cast-a-string-in-python/). The same was done for amount2.
2. I divided the sum with 100 using (/) to divide it into a float so that it is printed in euro and cent amount as shown in https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_arithmetic_operators.asp.
3. According to https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/ and https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/, f or f-strings means formatted string literals, which is a new string formatting approach in Python 3.6 and above. it is not a function. I also noticed spacing between prompt and result, so (\n) was applied.

Conclusion:
This output was achieved in the VS Code terminal:
Enter amount1(in cent): 65
Enter amount2(in cent): 180

The sum of these is €2.45
