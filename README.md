# pands-problem-sheet
Problem sheet for Programming and Scripting

WEEK 1 TASK: helloworld.py

Task 1 Description:
To create a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run then add, commit and push it into the pands-problem-sheet repository.

What it also entails: 
a. Creating a Github account containing two repositories: mywork (personal use) and pands-problem-sheet (for assessment) 
b. Making entries in README using markdown. 

Method:
1. Using VS Code, pands folder was created under the computer directory.
2. 3 subfolders were created under pands: a. mywork  b. pands-course-material  c. pands-problem-sheet
3. helloworld.py file was created under pands-problem-sheet. Comments were added to describe the code.
4. Code format followed that of (1).
5. Python print () function was used to create a string output onto the screen (2).
6. Python quote function was used for string representation (3).
7. Python bracket function indicates that round brackets are generally used in function (4).

Conclusion:
Python program that displays Hello World! in the terminal was created, added, committed and pushed into https://github.com/nurbujang/pands-problem-sheet and submitted.

WEEK 2 TASK: bank.py

Task 2 Description:
Banks store currency figures as integers (usually in cent) to avoid rounding errors. This task is to create a program that should prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent), then add the two amounts and finally print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

Enter amount1(in cent): 65
Enter amount2(in cent): 180

The sum of these is €2.45

Method:
1. Define and prompt amount1. Input is a string or text, so it had to be converted into numbers (1). The same was done for amount2.
2. I divided the sum with 100 using (/) to divide it into a float so that it is printed in euro and cent amount as shown in (2).
3. According to (3) and (4), f or f-strings means formatted string literals, which is a new string formatting approach in Python 3.6 and above. it is not a function. I also noticed spacing between prompt and result, so (\n) was applied.
4. The program was then tested using other amounts and consistently displayed the correct sum.

Conclusion:
This output was achieved from the bank.py program:
Enter amount1(in cent): 65
Enter amount2(in cent): 180

The sum of these is €2.45

The same output with the correct sum can be derived when different amounts are entered at prompts, eg:
Enter amount1(in cent): 53
Enter amount2(in cent): 173

The sum of these is €2.26
